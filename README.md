* **Head section:** The `<head>` section contains meta information about the document.
    * **Charset:** The `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
    * **Viewport:** The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />` tag sets the viewport for mobile devices to adjust the page according to the screen size.
    * **Stylesheet:** The `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />` tag links an external stylesheet file named "style.css" to the HTML document.
    * **Title:** The `<title>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</title>` tag specifies the title of the webpage as "Rock-Paper-Scissors Game".
* **Body section:** The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage.
    * **Heading:** The `<h1>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h1>` tag creates a heading element with the text "Rock-Paper-Scissors".
    * **Choices section:** The `<div class="choices">...</div>` section creates a container element with the class "choices". This section likely holds the options for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
        * **Choice elements:** The `<div class="choice" id="Rock">...</div>` elements create individual choice options within the game. Each choice element has a class "choice" and a unique id assigned based on the choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors). These elements likely contain images representing the choices.
            * **Image:** The `<img src="images/rock.png" alt="rock" />` tag inserts an image within the choice element. The source of the image is specified in the `src` attribute and an alternative text description is provided in the `alt` attribute.
    * **Scoreboard section:** The `<div class="scoreBoard">...</div>` section creates a container element with the class "scoreBoard". This section likely holds the scores of the user and the bot.
        * **Score elements:** The `<div class="score">...</div>` elements create individual sections to display the scores.
            * **User score:** The `<p class="userScore">0</p>` tag displays the user's score with the initial value set to 0.
            * **User label:** The `<p>YOU</p>` tag displays a label "YOU" next to the user's score.
            * **Bot score:** Similar to the user score elements, these tags display the bot's score with the initial value set to 0 and a label "BOT".  
    * **Message box:** The `<div class="msgBox">...</div>` section creates a container element with the class "msgBox". This section likely holds a message for the user.
        * **Message:** The `<p class="msg">Play Your Move</p>` tag displays a message "Play Your Move" within the message box.
* **Script:** The `<script src="script.js"></script>` tag references an external JavaScript file named "script.js". This script likely contains the logic behind the game functionalities like handling user interactions, game logic, and updating the scores.

**JavaScript Code** explained in bullet points:

* **Variable assignments:**
    * Selects elements from the HTML document using `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`:
        * `userScore`: Stores a reference to the element with the class ".userScore" (likely the user's score display).
        * `botScore`: Stores a reference to the element with the class ".botScore" (likely the bot's score display).
        * `choices`: Stores a list of all elements with the class ".choice" (likely the Rock, Paper, Scissors choices).
        * `message`: Stores a reference to the element with the class ".msg" (likely the message box for game status).
    * Initializes variables:
        * `userPoint`: Stores the user's score (starts at 0).
        * `botPoint`: Stores the bot's score (starts at 0).  
* **`showWinner` function:**
    * Takes three arguments:
        * `userWin`: Boolean value indicating if the user won (true) or lost (false).
        * `userChoice`: String representing the user's choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
        * `botChoice`: String representing the bot's choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
    * Updates the user's score if they won and displays a message with both user and bot choices along with a win/loss indicator.  
* **`drawGame` function:**
    * Simply updates the message box to display "DRAW GAME."  
* **`botOutput` function:**
    * Generates a random computer choice for the game.
        * Creates an array `randOutput` containing the possible choices ("Rock", "Paper", "Scissors").
        * Generates a random index between 0 and 2 (inclusive) using `Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)`.
        * Returns the bot's choice based on the random index from the `randOutput` array. 
* **`gameStart` function:**
    * Takes one argument:
        * `userChoice`: String representing the user's choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
    * Calls the `botOutput` function to get the bot's choice.
    * Checks for a tie:
        * If user choice matches bot choice, calls the `drawGame` function.
    * Otherwise, determines the winner using nested if-else statements:
        * Sets `userWin` to true initially.
        * Checks user's choice and updates `userWin` based on the losing condition (e.g., user picks Rock, bot picks Paper sets `userWin` to false).
    * Calls the `showWinner` function with `userWin`, `userChoice`, and `botChoice` to update scores and display the winner message.  
* **Event listener for choices:**
    * Loops through all the choices (`choices`) using `forEach`.
    * Attaches a click event listener to each choice element.
    * When a choice is clicked:
        * Gets the ID of the clicked choice element using `getAttribute("id")`. 
        * Calls the `gameStart` function and passes the clicked choice's ID (representing the user's choice).
